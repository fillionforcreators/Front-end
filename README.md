# Open-Source Web3-React-Redux-Tailwind-Template

This is an Open Source project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) is also installed for quick styling and [Rainbow Toolkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) which uses wagmi under the hood is also pre-installed for connections.
The redux folders are fully empty to allow full customization.


## Why use this Template
I created this template because everytime I needed to create a web3-react project, i hated doing all of this and it was a pain-in-the-ass. This template will help eliminate the stress involved in doing so and eliminate popular mistakes people make when creating a template.

Contributions are highly welcomed, send a detailed pull request to the repo and I'll check it out.
